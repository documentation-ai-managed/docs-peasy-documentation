## Best Practices for Documentation

Follow these guidelines to create maintainable docs that scale with your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structure" icon="layout">
    Organize into clear hierarchies: Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections. Link related pages with `<Card>` components for navigation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code Examples" icon="code">
    Always use language-specific fenced blocks. For multi-language support, wrap in `<CodeGroup>`.

````jsx
<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript fetch('/api/users') ```
  ```python requests.get('/api/users') ```
</CodeGroup>
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Versioning" icon="git-branch">
    Pin docs to releases using branches like `v1.0`. Promote stable versions to main.
